# HR-Data-Analytics
The project is about the attrition of employees in a company. I have used excel worksheet to import data. First of all, the data is studied thoroughly and checked for any mismatches in it. Duplicates and unwanted data are cleaned. Using pivot table, I got insights about the atrrition rates in different fields based on age, gender, department, education etc. There were 1470 employees initially. Out of them, 588 employees were females and 882 were males. 237 employees had undergone attrition with an attrition rate of 16.12%. Employees with bachelor degree had faced more attrition. On the basis of department, Sales department faced more attrition with a rate of 56.12%. Employees under the age group of 25-35 years have faced more attrition. Laboratory technicians and Sales executive job roles were under high risk of attrition. Pivot table have been created with filter tables on the basis of education field and Department. One can easily go through the entire trend of attrition by looking into the dashboard.
